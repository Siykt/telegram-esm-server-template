# A telegram nodejs server template with ESM support

This project serves as an open-source template for building server-side applications, with a focus on integrating Telegram bot functionalities using `Koa`, `TypeScript`, and the `node-telegram-bot-api` library. It incorporates a robust setup, including the custom `defineTGCommand` and `defineTGQueryCallback` methods to manage Telegram commands and inline button interactions efficiently. The project leverages `tsup` for building, with integrated ESLint + Prettier for maintaining clean, well-formatted code. It provides a scalable and maintainable foundation for developers looking to create web services or APIs with seamless Telegram bot integration.
